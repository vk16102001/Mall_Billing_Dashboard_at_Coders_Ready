# Mall_Billing_Dashboard_at_Coders_Ready
Hello everyone, myself Kale Vaishnavi, Trainee Coder at Coder;s Ready. During my internship i created Mall Billing Dashboard using Object Oriented Programming in Python. I am uploading jupyter notebook along with video explanation in this repository. Any suggestions are always welcome!!


## Objectives:
- Creating a mall billing dashboard, that can take information like name, phone number, number of units of medical purpose items, grocery items and cold drinks from user and generate bill with respective taxes with unique bill number.
- Adding buttons like clear, generate bill, clear, exit fro performing different functions on given data.
- Creating highly interactive Mall Billing Dashboard.

## Conclusion:
- With the help of the Tkinter library we, created an interface for the bill.
- Dashboard is divided into 6 Label Frames such as customer details, Medical purposes, Grocery items, Cold drinks, 2- Bill detail area.
- Customer Details: This Label Frame takes inputs from user like Customer's Names and phone numbers and also contains a text box in which we can enter previously generated bill numbers and search for their details with the help of the search button.
- Medical Purpose: This label frame takes inputs from user such as several units of medical products i.e Sanitizer, Mask, Hand Gloves, Dettol, Disprine and Thermal Gun.
- Grocery Items: This label frame takes input from user such as several units of Grocery items i.e Rice, Food oil, Wheat, Pulses, Flour, Flour, Suger.
- Cold Drinks: This label frame takes inputs from user such as several units of Cold drinks i.e Coke, Sprite, Lime, Fanta, Mazz and Mountain Dew.
- Bill Details Area: This Label Frame has 6 text boxes with their labels. On clicking the Total button, Total Medical Price, Total grocery price Total Cold Drinks price will give total prices i.e sum of the product of several units of each product and its price of each section in medical purpose items, grocery items and cold drinks respectively and Medical Tax, Grocery Tax and Cold Drinks Tax will give the applicable total amount of taxes on all medical purpose products, Grocery items and Cold drinks respectively.
- Generate bill button will give bill receipts in the above-specified format with all entered information by the user, bill number and the total amount of the bill and will also save the bill.
- Clear Button will clear all entered data by the user.
- Exit Button will exit the application.
- We Can add new items in any section, and change the prices of each product and its applicable taxes by making required changes in the code easily.
